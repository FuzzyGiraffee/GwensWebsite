    <h1>Gwenily's List</h1>
        <h2>Please install uBlock Origin or Brave Browser, regardless of if you use any resources listed here. </h2>
    <!-- Hyperling Ublock Origin and Brave Browser to https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock and https://brave.com/respectivly -->
            <p1>uBlock is more than just an adblocker. It's a tracker blocker, malware blocker, phisher blocker. It's lightweight, and often makes virtually every site you visit faster as a result of removing stuff only meant to hurt you. Even aside from this list, but especially for resources in this list, you should have this installed. No, ABP is not good enough, and is shady. Use uBO.</p1>
            <p1>Soon, uBO will break on chromium based browsers due to Google's push for manifest v3 and its seemingly targeted approach to crippling adblock. If you want to use uBO, userscripts, and other extensions which rely on how manifest v2 handles extensions, please switch to Firefox and harden it (resources below).</p1>
     <!--Hyperlink manifest v3 and Firefox to https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation and https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ respectvly-->
            <p1>If you want to keep using a chromium based browser, Brave is the only one i can recommend for a number of reasons. On the ad/tracker blocking front, Brave comes with Brave Shields, which is a built in ad/tracker blocker that uses the same lists as uBO, however the control and customization is not as flexible as uBO is. If you insist on using a chromium based browser that isn't Brave, at least install uBO Lite.</p1>

        <h2>What is this list?</h2>
            <p1>A collection of things I personally use, think are useful, or that I think are generally neat. I want to both shine light on things that deserve more attention as well as provide peers with what amounts to a repository of services, tools, and even tutorials to some extent. Oh, and cool stuff.</p1>
        <h2>Notice any typos, broken links, or out-of-date information?</h2>
            <p1>Please open an issue, or create a pull request. You may also open an issue if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.</p1>

        <h2>How do I use this list?</h2>
            <p1>Some items could easily fit in more than one category. Use Ctrl + F (or Cmd + F on macOS) to find what you're looking for. Items are in no particular order. If you find something interesting, you can middle click it to open it in a new tab!</p1>
            <p1>Also, consider bookmarking this page if you find it valuable! Ironically enough i personally use it all the time, even though I made it x3</p1>
